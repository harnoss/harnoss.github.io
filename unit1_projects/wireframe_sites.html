	<p>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there? </b>
	The website helps companies connect to a service for video production. As such, it's a sales channel for Epipheo. I see a two-folded challenge: 1) How to explain the service PLUS in a way that at the same time, serves as an example for what they do (they explain things well with videos) 2) Lower the barriers to get in touch with prospective clients as much as possible. Thus, the visual challenge is to make clients sign up for the consultantion service without coming across as too agressive. They do this extremely well in my opinion through a design that comes across as more like a sketch from a child in the kindergarden than a professional designer who was paid to impress.

	The website is both an online coffee shop as well as an online directory for BlueBottle coffee (who they are, where they are, what they can tell you about coffee). The visual challenge is to strike that balance as I assume that people go on that site with very different motivations (some want to buy coffee, others just find the closest coffee place, others want to partner up in B2B business). How do you make everyone find what he/she is looking for? That's the challenge. Finally, as a "high-end" coffee shop the site also needs to fit to what it stands for offline (and not just feel like any other online shop). I feel they do this pretty well through using photos and a very clear site structure/navigation.

	The website explains what Pocket is and how to use it. Thus, the challenge is to explain the App and convince prospective users in just 5 seconds. At the same time, the website should come across as simple and easy-to-grasp as possible as this will reflect the quality of the App itself in the eyes of a prospective user. At the heart of the current solution are the tag line "When you find something you want to view later, put it in pocket" (This is what Pocket does) as well as the visuals (pictures of an ipad next to a cup of coffee -> This is what Pocket means to you/how it fits into your daily live).
