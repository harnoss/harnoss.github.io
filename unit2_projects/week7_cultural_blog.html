                    <h2>The stereotype threat</h2>
                    <p>I know the concept of the "stereotype threat" from a class in my graduate studies. The example that we had discussed back then and that got stuck with me was that of a teacher who told all of his students with brown eyes that they were superior to those with other eye colors. As a result, they performed better (and they others worse). After a week, the teacher announced that he had been wrong and had mixed up the groups: It's actually the blue/green eyed colored students that are more intelligent. As a result, blue/green eye colored students became top-performers and brown eye colored moved to the bottom. This demonstrated how a negative belief ("stereotype") about the group that you belong to (whether you hold it or others) affects you no matter what. </p>

                    <p>Fortunately, I feel that I have never been a victim of stereotypes. But I have been thinking about it a alot and the one point I would like to focus on are jokes. Depending on your type of humour, there are various stereotype-related jokes around your nationality, religion, gender or alike. I think we are often too unaware of the strong side effects of telling these seamingly small/funny jokes, which are that they substantiate stereotypes. This is something that I would like to be more aware of going forward.</p>
