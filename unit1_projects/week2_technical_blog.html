		<p>Everyone who is new to CSS will eventually run into this existential question:
			"What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?"

			The basic structure of a website can be best compared to a chain of pearls that is going from left to right, one element after another. Based on this,<br />
			<strong>Relative positioning</strong> is like taking one of the pearls out of it's default position in the chain and moving it up or down, left or right. The positioning commands are always <em>relative to its default position</em>. Two things are important to know: The pearl is still part of the chain (the flow) and the other pearls still think that the pearl is in its default position.<br />
			<strong>Absolute positioning</strong> is like taking one of the pearls and removing it from the chain. Then, one specifies the position top-right-bottom-left <em>relative to its parent element</em> (not relative to its default position).<br />
			<strong>Fixed positioning</strong> is exactely like absolute position with one difference: The positioning is always <em>relative to the browser window</em> (not its parent element) and is fixed there, so it stays even if one scrolls the page up or down.</p>
			<p>A great way to practice positioning is to build a simple 2x2 matrix in html and CSS. Look here is an example to hone your skills:</p>

		<p>Today, I wanna share three websites with you that for me stand out in terms of user experience and design: <a href="epipheo.com">Epipheo</a>, <a href="pocket.com">Pocket</a>, and <a href="bluebottlecoffee.com">BlueBottle</a></p>

		<p>There is one particular aspect that all of these three websites have in common: An almost perfect fit between design and product/service positioning - or put differently, the way the site feels and the way these companies want to be felt by their customers. </p>

		<p> Pocket feels simple, convenient, to-the-point (and that's what they do for you). BlueBottle does not just sell coffee, but rather a way of live/a way of enjoying and experiencing your favorite drink. This is how their website feels as well - a tribute to coffee. It takes some time to realize that it also is a shop. Epipheo finally, stands out as a site that screams at you "We are creative!" (and that's why you want their services). It is a website you have not seen before and you will remember. This is exactely what they promise to their clients: To make their ideas stick. </p>

		<p> Getting into the details of the user experience of these three websites, there are two cases I would like to point to where designers have done an especially good job: One, the shop navigation at BlueBottle; two, the "contact for consultation" area at Epipheo. </p>

		<p> BlueBottle faced the question: "How do people shop for coffee?" Other shops answer this question with "Easy, they look for coffee brands or where the beans come from!" so that's the way they structure their shop. BlueBottle, however, takes a different route: They structure the shop navivation around the question of "How do you brew your coffee?" and then offer different kinds of brewing methods (from french press to espresso) to choose from. Clearly, a way to help customers find what they look for (as a coffee fan I feel that they have hit the nail on the head with this menu) as well as communicate what BlueBottle stands for: Not just another coffee shop, but one that knows coffee better than anyone. </p>

		<p> Epipheo on the other hand, uses its website to generate leads for prospective clients. So how do you make users getting in touch with you/giving you their contact without coming across as too agressively selling your service? Answer: Make it look like accepting the invitation to a fun birthday party instead of a boring business meeting. Genius.</p>
