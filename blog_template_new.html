                    <h2>My story</h2>
                    <p>When I was working as a consultant, the people I was working with would change every 2-3 months or so. Due to the nature of the work, you are usually working side-by-side for long hours in the same room. I remember one project, where I worked with a project manager with who I would have an emotional conflict. This emotional conflict wouldn't surface in the day to day work, though: we would greet each other, respect each other, and work with each other. </p>

                    <h2>What happened then?</h2>
                    <p>At the same time, however, he was quiet often unhappy with the quality of my work, critiquing how I would handle my clients, how I would create powerpoint documents, or even how I would write my emails. My initial reaction was something along the lines of "feedback is a gift" and "perception is reality", so if he told me so, he was right and I had to improve. I worked harder and did everything I could to please him and mimic his way of doing things. I regularily asked him for more feedback and always tried to avoid conflict and discontent. This way, weeks passed, I managed to do my job and got finally assigned to a new project. I felt incredibly relieved. </p>
                    
                    <h2>What <em> actually </em> happened here?</h2>
                    <p>Looking back, I have asked myself a few times already: What actually happened here?</p> 

                    <p>In hindsight, I feel that beyond the technical dicussion on what the slide or email should look like, there was a deeper emotional conflict between him and me that we never managed to bring to light and resolve.</p> 

                    <p> From my side, I felt very unsecure because of the level of distrust he would have in me and my work. I need encouragement from time to time, if not I can tend to get into a downward spiral. From his side, I think he somehow disapproved my mentality and attitude towards work:</p> 
                    <p>For me work needs to be fun and meaningful. I even enjoy making it playful, doing some experiments, trying out new stuff to learn from what works and what doesn't. I don't like my mails to look like they could have been written by any other consultant. 
                    For him, however, I feel that work was something he would label as "needs to adhere to the highest standards of professionalism". Being a "professional", for him meant to be always correct, always in check, always do exactely what is expected, and be 100% dependable.</p> 

                    <p> Thus, in hindsight, I feel that our work ethics and values were not aligned and this was the actual reason for why we would have so much friction when it came to getting the work done. If I could go back in time, I would try to surface that. It's not that difficult, once you are aware of how different values drive different behaviors. What brings you down the "iceberg" are "why"-questions, e.g. "you seem to be upset about the work I did, why?" and then an other "why?" and another...until you get to the roots of things.</p>

                    <p> All in all, I learned to be more aware of how deeper misalignments and misunderstandings drive the behavior and conflicts that we actually see. I learned  that avoiding conflict and discontent leaves these things where they are: In the deep dark water below the surface. An open, respectful, controversial discussion to resolve a conflict can be much healthier than just getting along.</p>
