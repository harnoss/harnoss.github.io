		<p>Today, I wanna share three websites with you that for me stand out in terms of user experience and design: <a href="epipheo.com">Epipheo</a>, <a href="pocket.com">Pocket</a>, and <a href="bluebottlecoffee.com">BlueBottle</a></p>

		<p>There is one particular aspect that all of these three websites have in common: An almost perfect fit between design and product/service positioning - or put differently, the way the site feels and the way these companies want to be felt by their customers. </p>

		<p> Pocket feels simple, convenient, to-the-point (and that's what they do for you). BlueBottle does not just sell coffee, but rather a way of live/a way of enjoying and experiencing your favorite drink. This is how their website feels as well - a tribute to coffee. It takes some time to realize that it also is a shop. Epipheo finally, stands out as a site that screams at you "We are creative!" (and that's why you want their services). It is a website you have not seen before and you will remember. This is exactely what they promise to their clients: To make their ideas stick. </p>

		<p> Getting into the details of the user experience of these three websites, there are two cases I would like to point to where designers have done an especially good job: One, the shop navigation at BlueBottle; two, the "contact for consultation" area at Epipheo. </p>

		<p> BlueBottle faced the question: "How do people shop for coffee?" Other shops answer this question with "Easy, they look for coffee brands or where the beans come from!" so that's the way they structure their shop. BlueBottle, however, takes a different route: They structure the shop navivation around the question of "How do you brew your coffee?" and then offer different kinds of brewing methods (from french press to espresso) to choose from. Clearly, a way to help customers find what they look for (as a coffee fan I feel that they have hit the nail on the head with this menu) as well as communicate what BlueBottle stands for: Not just another coffee shop, but one that knows coffee better than anyone. </p>

		<p> Epipheo on the other hand, uses its website to generate leads for prospective clients. So how do you make users getting in touch with you/giving you their contact without coming across as too agressively selling your service? Answer: Make it look like accepting the invitation to a fun birthday party instead of a boring business meeting. Genius.</p>
